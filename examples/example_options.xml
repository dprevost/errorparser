<!-- /usr/local/share/xml/errorParser/errorParserOptions10
   This xml file provides the options to the errorParser program.
   
   Why a file? The number of options was getting too large. Using a file
   makes it easier to manage all these options and it will also make 
   easier to add new options in the future (as needed). 
   [Since changing options is usually something that will be done rarely
   once you are satisfy with the results, storing the options in a file 
   makes it easier to reuse the same options, evidently]
   
   Why xml? Easier to program (libxml2 does the parsing) and easy to
   provide default values for some of the attributes.

       If absent, the current directory will be used.

       Alternatively, you can put the directory directly in the 2 
       "errmsg_*_name" elements. If you do, the "GUARD" will use that 
       directory name and the .c file will include the header using the 
       full name (errmsg_header_name) -->

  <!-- How to handle the error message. The problem: the generated C strings
       will be use, eventually, by standard C/C++ libraries and some 
       sequence of characters could have some bad side effects, possibly
       including security issues.
       The defaults:
         - escape sequences are not permitted (a more fine grain approach
           could be written if the need arise).
         - quotes (' and ") are allowed (and will be escaped as needed) 
         - The % symbol. No default. I recommend the textual "percent" 
           (% is the most problematic one, IMHO. %d %p, etc are interpreted
           differently by libc (printf()) and the iostream library (cout) -->
