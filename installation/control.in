Description: errorParser is a code generator for error files.
It simplify the development of code for handling errors (and the associated
documentation) by keeping all the required information in a single location, 
an XML input file.
.
The parser uses this file to generate the header file for errors, the code 
to access the error messages and the documentation (only doxygen is supported
for this release).
.
Error messages and associated documentation can be written in multiple 
languages (although one language must be selected when parsing).
