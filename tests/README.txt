All the tests uses errorParser (evidently). 

The current set of tests always produced output files which are then 
compared with "known good files". If identical, the tests pass.

There are no tests to check the syntax of the xml files themselves - the 
parser of libxml2 is presumed to be working correctly (it would be 
possible to add tests for this if problems are encountered).

--------------------------------------------------

Directories:

options
  This directory is for the xml files used to store options for errorParser.

xml
  This directory is used for the input xml files (containing the definitions
  of errors for the tests).
  
baseline
   This directory contains subdirectories (one for each test) for the 
   reference output files (which will be compared with the output files
   generated by the tests).

junk
   Directory created on the fly (if absent) to put temporary output files. 
   If an error occurs, the temporary files are not removed and they can 
   be used to debug the tests or the program.

--------------------------------------------------

Description of the tests:

french
   the option file ask for English ('en') but there is only a French ('fr')
   message in the xml file. The French message should be used (in other
   words, the first <message>, irrespective of its xml:lang attribute).

multi_copyright  
   the xml file has multiple copyright statements. They should all appear in
   the output files.

no_copyright 
   there is no copyright information in the xml file. Since this field is
   optional, this should be ok.

no_groupdesc 
   the <groupdescript> is missing for some <errgroup>. Since this field is
   optional, this should be ok.

no_groupident
   the <groupident> is missing for some <errgroup>. Since this field is
   optional, this should be ok.

no_version 
   the version attribute is missing from <errorlist>. Since this field is
   optional, this should be ok.

one_error 
   a single error. Should be ok (getError.c is the possible critical point
   since it deals with an array of pointers with a single element).

two_english
   two <message xml:lang="en">. The first one should be used and the second 
   one should be ignored.
