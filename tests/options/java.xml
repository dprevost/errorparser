<!-- 
   This xml file provides the options to the errorParser program.
   
   Why a file? The number of options was getting too large. Using a file
   makes it easier to manage all these options and it will also make 
   easier to add new options in the future (as needed). 
   [Since changing options is usually something that will be done rarely
   once you are satisfy with the results, storing the options in a file 
   makes it easier to reuse the same options, evidently]
   
   Why xml? Easier to program (libxml2 does the parsing) and easy to
   provide default values for some.

        <!-- How to handle the error message. The problem: the generated C strings
         will be use, eventually, by standard C/C++ libraries and some 
         sequence of characters could have some bad side effects, possibly
         including security issues.
         The defaults:
           - escape sequences are not permitted (a more fine grain approach
             could be written if the need arise).
           - quotes (' and ") are allowed (and will be escaped as needed) 
           - The % symbol. No default. I recommend the textual "percent" 
             (% is the most problematic one, IMHO. %d %p, etc are interpreted
             differently by libc (printf()) and the iostream library (cout) -->
